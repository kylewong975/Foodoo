# Foodoo

Foodoo is a minimalistic app that makes selecting restaurants and menu items more efficient. It leverages text messaging functionalities in a pure backend (server-side) implementation using Twilio API and place recommendations using Foursquare API. 

I was very passionate about this project that even though our team had an even more impressive idea to be made for LA Hacks, I took a 4 hour break to make this project just for fun!

### Inspiration

I am personally a foodie, so I often spend a lot of time deciding where to eat and what places are popular. This is where apps like Yelp and Google Maps come into play. What if you want to eat something you are craving for but you are in a rush, such as during lunch in Downtown LA or NYC? This is where this app will quickly find the top 5 places for you to go to, ordered by distance, so that you can satisfy your craving before you know it! Stuck with choosing burgers or pizza? This app will also recommend menu items at a particular restaurant based on what you usually like and what you are currently craving for.
